A\nlocal business owner requested relief for Oak Park service oriented businesses who may\nneed to park for longer than permitted in areas of the Village in order to complete their\nwork for homeowners; for example a cleaning service that requires four hours to complete\nwork on a block with two hour parking restrictions.

The\ncommission did consider opening up the program to out of town businesses but did not\nsee that there was a great need and that it seemed reasonable to start with Oak Park\nbusinesses. Members of the Village Board decided to expand the proposed program to\ninclude businesses from outside of Oak Park at a 25% higher rate.

As the\nBoard is approaching the end of the Eisenhower study sessions, it was mentioned that\nsimilar strategy could be used with parking and to begin to have at least one study\nsession each month to have conversations related to parking and progressively work\nthrough the 18 month time period.

She discussed services provided, signage, and the history of the overnight parking\nban and various other parking regulations, as well as projects included in the 2016 work\nplan. She stated that representatives from Walker Parking Consultants donated their time\nas follow-up to their 2008 study to go over some of the things that have been\nimplemented. They noted that a parking system''s goal should be to improve access to\nresidential and commercial properties, improve the delivery of public parking services,\nmaintain fair and equitable parking regulations, support economic development and\ncommunity vitality, maximize use of existing resources and consider the safety of\npedestrians and motorists. Ms. Velan recommended hiring a consultant to assist in this\nproject. She added that if funds are spent on new technology, signage or updates to\nonline services, the Village should ensure that everything in the code, as well as any other\nregulations, be in unified form.\nComments were made by the Trustees. Village President Abu-Taleb summarized that\nthere is consensus that this is a big challenge and will have to be worked on one issue at\na time. The downtown area is the biggest challenge at this time, as there is no more\nsurface parking. People need to know that there''s parking available in the garages. He\nnoted that revisiting the fee structure can be addressed right away and asked that staff\nbring back the issue of the first two hours free in the Holley Court and Lake and Forest\ngarages at the next Board meeting. He noted that the Board has a lot to take in at once\nbut needed to work on addressing immediate concerns first. He did not want to impact the\nbusinesses and residents in a negative way.

She noted the locations. Ms. Grossman stated that staff\nand businesses have been promoting the valet service. She commented that most of the\nusers are non-residents. Staff is recommending continuing through the next six months\nto test their promotional tactics and build on the success of the program.\nVillage Trustee Andrews calculated that for a cost of $206,000 a year to the Village, to\npark an average of 4,341 vehicles, $23,000 in revenue is generated. This means that the\nVillage pays a subsidy of $42 for every vehicle on top of what the customer pays. He\ncommented that no other business districts have valet parking and if the downtown\nbusinesses want valet parking, that is something that should be done through Downtown\nOak Park and/or Visit Oak Park. He is supportive of ending the valet parking. Village\nTrustees Boutet, Tucker and Button also agreed. Village Trustee Taglia commented that\nit served its purpose during construction and there is no reason to keep it.\nMs. Grossman noted that the contract does not end until January and it is being\npromoted heavily for the holiday season. The Board agreed to honor the contract until the\nend of January. Village Manager Pavlicek stated that staff would appropriate four weeks\nworth of the service in the budget.\n','\n',char(10)),NULL);
